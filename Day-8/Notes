    In java we have two types of kedword:
      - Reserved Keyword (51)

   underscore(_) can't be use as identifier or variable name.

 * goto is not in use

 Upto JDK 8, there were 50 keywords but from JDK 9 its 51 just because of underscore added into the list of keywords.

As per the recent version of java 21, there are 51 reserved keyword
where as 17 contextual keywords.
